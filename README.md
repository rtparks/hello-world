# hello-world

Hi GitHub!

I am a new programmer looking to expand my skills and reach within the programming community. I am currently a full time college student and I am a little over half way through my first programming course (Intro to Python). Needless to say, my focus right now is python. I have always had a gut feeling that I wanted to pursue a career in programming, however I am looking to get my undergrad degree in IT. My hope is to minor in programming and to learn as much about the skill as I can on my spare time. Thanks!
